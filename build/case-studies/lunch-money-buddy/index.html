<h2>Designing a mobile app from the ground up</h2>
<aside class="project-aside">
<h4>Lunch Money Buddy is not real, but there really are apps that do these things.</h4>
<p>Some examples of lunch-money-management apps in the real world include <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myschoolbucks/id661878685?mt=8">MySchoolBucks</a> and <a href="https://www.myschoolaccount.com">myschoolaccount.com</a>. Apps like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutrislice.schoollunch&amp;hl=en">School Lunch by Nutrislice</a> allow parents to check the lunch menu ahead of time, so they can decide whether to pack lunches or let kids purchase them. Some products in this vein even allow parents to pre-order lunches, which wasn’t part of the specification for Lunch Money Buddy.</p>
</aside>
<p>During the entire 7-week Interaction Design class, we worked on a mobile app called “Lunch Money Buddy.” We received personas, a specification document (a simple list “from stakeholders” outlining what the app should do), and instructions to create various deliverables that would help us dig into interaction design concepts and challenges.</p>
<p>Lunch Money Buddy is a hypothetical mobile app that allows parents and guardians of schoolchildren to manage the students’ lunch money electronically. The core features of Lunch Money Buddy are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add funds to a central Lunch Money Buddy account which children can use to pay for school lunches</li>
<li>Replenish funds automatically when the account is empty (optional)</li>
<li>View the school lunch menu</li>
<li>Mark kids’ “favorites” and get notified when those foods are being served (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<p>During the first week, we created journey maps and a sitemap (a.k.a. blueprint) which set the scene for the rest of the design activities in the course. We then spent two weeks creating wireframes, and three weeks creating an interactive prototype. The final week of the course, we prepared for a usability study that would test the designs we’d created.</p>
<p>(We didn’t carry out the study as part of the course, but we’d learned how to do that in the previous two classes: Researching the User Experience I &amp; II.)</p>

<h3>Journey maps</h3>
<p>For each of the two provided personas, we were asked to make two journey maps. These maps showed how the app would fit into the personas’ lives. In each map, I created several scenarios and made design recommendations for each—mostly, I focused on aspects of the experience that I thought might be easy to miss when my head is deep in the details of a wireframe or prototype.</p>
